<h2>Studies</h2>
During the 3-year-long BSc I worked on avarious projects and courseworks including those in <b>Deep Learning and Neural Networks, Big Data, and Software Engineering</b>.

In my <b>final year project project</b> titled <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCIâ€™s)"</i> I applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting. 
To achieve that I used <b>Python, its libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b>.

My deliverables are two formulas describing global brain activity during rest and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas.
