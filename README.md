### <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
I am a graduate form <b>Imperial College London</b> skilled in Brain-Machine interfaces, Neural decoders, Data analysis, Real-time systems, and Web development<br><br>
I look forward to graduate opportunities in Brain Machine Interface R&D, Web and Software Development<br>
<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>MSc Neurotechnology</b>, Imperial College London (2022-2024)</li>
<li><b>BSc Computer Science</b>, Queen Mary University of London (2019-2022)</li>
<br>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<li><h4>Final year project (Computer Science BSc)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title:</b> <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCIâ€™s)"</i> </li>
<li>Carried out research and applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting</li>
<li>Analysed data using <b>Python, matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b></li>
<li>Deliverables: <b>two formulas describing global brain activity during rest</b> and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
