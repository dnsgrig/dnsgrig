### <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
- I've recently graduated in <b>Computer Science BSc</b> from Queen Mary University of London.<br>
- During my studies I've developed an interest in technologies capable of <b>augmenting human abilities</b>.<br>
- In particular, <b>Brain-Machine Interfaces</b> and how this technology can help us understand human brain and improve its funtions.<br>

âœ¨ To pursue my interest further I will be studyng an <b>MSc in Biomedical Engineering (Neurotechnology) at Imperial College London</b>.<br><br>
âš¡ I'm open to new exciting opportunities in <b>machine learning, brain data analysis, business projects, and neurotechnology</b>. <br><br>
ðŸ“« <b>My contact details are below!</b><br>

<h2>Studies</h2>
<ul>
<li>During my undergraduate years I worked on various projects, courseworks, and achieved high marks including those in: <br>
<ul>
<li><b>Deep Learning and Neural Networks</b></li> 
<li><b>Big Data Processing</b></li>
<li><b>Software Engineering</b></li>
<br></li>
</ul>
<li><h4>Final year project (Computer Science BSc)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title:</b> <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCIâ€™s)"</i> </li>
<li>In my final year project project I carried out research and applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting.</li>
<li>To achieve that I used <b>Python, libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b>.</li>
<li>My deliverables are <b>two formulas describing global brain activity during rest</b> and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Supracurrilucar</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>QIncubator</b>: I participated in a college enterprise programme where I learnt basics of finding an opportunity in the market, starting, and running a business</li>
  <li><b>London Business School Hackathon 2021</b>: I took part in the hackathon with an idea that would help large companies efficiently offset their carbon footprint by investing in blue carbon solutions. I worked in a cross-disciplinary team on developing a product, business model, and a prototype in Figma
  </li>
  <li><b>Tech company</b>: I have put my skills into practice and started a tech company that develops digital planners</li>
  <li><b>Independent study of neuroscience and neurotechnology:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>I study the Berkeley Neuroscience online course</li>
    <li>I read research papers and books like The Neurotech Primer</li>
    <li>I participate in networking events as Imperial College MedTech SuperConnector</li>
