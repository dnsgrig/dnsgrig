<li><h4>Final year project (Computer Science BSc)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title:</b> <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCI’s)"</i> </li>
<li>In my final year project project I carried out research and applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting.</li>
<li>To achieve that I used <b>Python, libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b>.</li>
<li>My deliverables are <b>two formulas describing global brain activity during rest</b> and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas.</li>
  </ul>
