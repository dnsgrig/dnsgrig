<h2>My story</h2>
<p>Studying <FONT COLOR=blue>BSc Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London I became curious about how computation is carried out beyond the world of man made computers.

Human brain - the most advanced biological processor has captured my attention and so I went on conducting a final year project titled ‚Äú*Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCI‚Äôs)*‚Äù where I investigated how the processing of brain signals without user‚Äôs direct intervention can be used to implicitly control a brain machine interface.</p>
<p>To pursue my academic passion further I enrolled at an MSc Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Neurotechnology at Imperial College London, meanwhile winning a highly competitive scholarship from the Department of Bioengineering. I have completed the masters thesis ‚ÄúTowards collision-free movement in arbitrary environments using a Fly-Robot-Interface‚Äù in the lab of Prof. Holger Krapp where I redesigned a brain-machine interface bio-hybrid robotic intelligent system (Fly-Robotic-Interface) used by the lab to investigate insect‚Äôs sensorimotor control mechanisms. My innovative and efficient system design will reduce coding and testing time in future research projects by 50%.</p>
<p>In spare time I participated in a G.tec medical engineering Spring School & Hackathon and experimented with using Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) to control a Unity 3D game character, gaining skills in API integration and game design.</p>
<p>I have also moderated a global hybrid hackathon in neurotechnology NeuroTechX 2023.</p>
