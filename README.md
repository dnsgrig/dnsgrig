<ul>
<li>During my undergraduate years I worked on various projects, courseworks, and achieved high marks including those in: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Deep Learning and Neural Networks (TBC)</b></li> 
<li><b>Big Data Processing               (79.4 %)</b></li>

<li><h4>Final year project (Computer Science BSc)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title:</b> <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCIâ€™s)"</i> </li>
<li>In my final year project project I carried out research and applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting.</li>
<li>To achieve that I used <b>Python, libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b>.</li>
<li>My deliverables are <b>two formulas describing global brain activity during rest</b> and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>QIncubator</b>: I participated in a college enterprise programme where I learnt basics of finding an opportunity in the market, starting, and running a business</li>
  <li><b>London Business School Hackathon 2021</b>: I took part in the hackathon with an idea that would help large companies efficiently offset their carbon footprint by investing in blue carbon solutions. I worked in a cross-disciplinary team on developing a product, business model, and a prototype in Figma
  </li>
  <li><b>Tech company</b>: I have put my skills into practice and started a tech company that develops digital planners</li>
  <li><b>Independent study of neuroscience and neurotechnology:</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>I study the Berkeley Neuroscience online course</li>
