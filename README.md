### <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
- I've recently graduated in <b>Computer Science BSc</b> from Queen Mary University of London.<br>
- During my studies I've developed an interest in technologies capable of <b>augmenting human abilities</b>.<br>
- In particular, <b>Brain-Machine Interfaces</b> and how this technology can help us understand human brain and improve its funtions.<br>

âœ¨ To pursue my interest further I will be studyng an <b>MSc in Biomedical Engineering (Neurotechnology) at Imperial College London</b>.

<h2>Studies</h2>
<ul>
<li>During my undergraduate years I worked on various projects and courseworks including those in <b>Deep Learning and Neural Networks, Big Data, and Software Engineering</b>.<br></li>
<li><h4>Final year project</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title:</b> <i>"Relating brain information processing patterns to activities and inferring user state
in passive brain-machine interfaces (pBCIâ€™s)"</i> </li>
<li>In my final year project project I applied <b>statistical analysis on EEG brain data</b> to relate global neuronal co-activity patterns to specific activities like resting.</li>
<li>To achieve that I used <b>Python, libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and Jupyter notebook</b>.</li>
<li>My deliverables are <b>two formulas describing global brain activity during rest</b> and a 
blueprint of a pBCI system that infers user sate based on these formulas.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
